# 👋 About Me

I’m **Paras Chavan**, a backend-first software engineer focused on building **reliable, production-ready web systems** — not just demos that work on localhost.

My core strength is designing and implementing **clean backend architectures**:
- Authentication & authorization (RBAC)
- API design and data modeling
- Caching, rate limiting, and failure handling
- Writing code that stays maintainable after the first release

I strongly prefer **boring, proven solutions** over flashy but fragile ones, and I care about correctness, structure, and long-term reliability.

On the frontend, I work comfortably with **React** to build clear, functional interfaces — but my primary focus remains the backend, where system design decisions actually matter.

## 🛠 What I’ve Been Building Recently

- Multi-tenant backends with teams and role-based access control  
- High-volume API ingestion systems with caching and rate limiting  
- AI-assisted backend features (RAG-based services) using Python & FastAPI  

I use AI as a **productivity tool, not a crutch** — designing systems myself and leveraging AI to accelerate implementation, testing, and review.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Backend engineering with **Node.js & TypeScript**
- **MongoDB** data modeling and query optimization
- **Redis** for caching and rate limiting
- Dockerized development and cloud-ready deployments
- Applying AI responsibly in real production systems

---

## 🤝 Looking For

- Engineering-driven collaborations
- Open-source backend projects
- Paid **internship / junior backend roles** where I can ship real features, learn from strong engineers, and contribute value from day one
